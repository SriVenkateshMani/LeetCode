# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems.

## 📌 Purpose
- To track and improve my problem-solving skills.
- To maintain a well-organized archive of solved coding challenges.
- To revisit and optimize past solutions when needed.

## 📁 Structure
Each folder is named after the problem number and title and contains the corresponding code solution.

## 💬 Notes
Some solutions may include comments or explanations for better understanding. I occasionally revisit and refactor code for clarity and performance.

## 🛠️ Language
All solutions are written in **Python**.

## ✅ Progress
This repository will be updated regularly as I solve more problems.
